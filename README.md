## About The Project
The Figma Dashboard project is a front-end development task that aimed to recreate a dashboard based on a specific design provided in Figma. The project's primary objective was to demonstrate the ability to convert Figma designs into functional web pages, utilizing various technologies, including Anima for prototyping and Highcharts for creating interactive charts.

## Technologies Used
- React: JavaScript library used for building the user interface.
- Anima: Used for converting Figma designs into HTML and CSS.
- Highcharts: Employed to create interactive charts and graphs for the dashboard.
- HTML/CSS: The foundation for the project's structure and styling.

## Setup / Installation
To set up and run the Figma Dashboard project locally, follow these steps:
1. Clone the GitHub repository to your computer:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Itaybo89/task-figma.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd task-figma
   ```
3. Install the necessary dependencies using npm:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```
5. Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to view the project.

## Challenges and Learning
This project was particularly challenging due to my initial unfamiliarity with Anima and Highcharts. However, through dedicated research and practice, I was able to effectively utilize these tools to achieve the project's goals. This experience has significantly enhanced my understanding of web development tools and has improved my ability to adapt to new technologies.

## Status
- The project is currently in a completed state. Future updates may include responsive design improvements and additional interactive elements.

## Credits
- This project was developed by me as part of a front-end development task. I would like to thank the design team for providing the Figma design that served as the foundation for this project.
